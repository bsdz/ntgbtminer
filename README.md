ntgbtminer
==========

ntgbtminer is a no thrills
[getblocktemplate](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Getblocktemplate) Bitcoin miner.
It is not performant, but demonstrates basic use of the getblocktemplate
protocol for a standalone Bitcoin miner. It has no dependencies outside of
standard Python libraries and a JSON-HTTP connection to your local Bitcoin
daemon.

This is forked from original [ntgbtminer](https://github.com/vsergeev/ntgbtminer) and updated
to run on Python 3+ with some simplifications to aid my understanding of bitcoin mining.
